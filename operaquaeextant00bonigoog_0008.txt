PREFAOE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.

*Δ

Tus first volume of this edition contains the
Epistles of St. Boniface3 and in the present
volume will be found several other worlrs which
are attributed to the same writer, but have never
before been collected under his name. .

The first two articles, headed Junsusurunr
and comum, have hitherto been inserted among·
the Letters: they are here kept distinct merely
for the purpose of preserving a more accurate
classification.

The accounts which remain to us of the dis:
ferent synods held by St. Boniface in Ger?
many were most probably compiled by himself,³
and therefore may with great propriety be in-¹
eluded ina collection of his worlrs. Among
the Concilia will be found a chapter headed
Statuta δια, (p. 22) which often appears sepa-
rate in the Manuscripts. It is necessary to

mention this that the reader may not suppose it
has been omitted in this edition. These Ssnrurr,
as well as the short tract Dr Pmurrmrrm, were
first printed in D’Achery’s Spicilegium, and have'
been compared with ants, of the twelfth century
