. The eleventh speaks of the two kingdoms
which God has established; one is the kingdom
of this world, the other of that which is to come.
,To reign hereafter, we must live well here; that is,
we must avoid evil and do good. We were made
Christians that we might always be occupied with
the thoughts ofa future world and eternal life.

The twelfth is an exhortation to fast during
Laut.. The author calculates only forty-two
days, including the six Sundays, which were not
observed as fast-days. At that time, therefore,
the four days which precede the first Sunday in
Lent, beginning with Ash-Wednesday, must have
been excluded from the number. To render the
fast of Lent perfect, the Saint implies that the
mind should be given up to holy thoughts in
proportion as the body was mortified by abstain-
ing from its usual aliments.

The thirteenth homily contains further re-

marks on the duty of fasting.
