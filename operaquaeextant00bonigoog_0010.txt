The third homily is entitled Os the troosold
Worlcs os Righteousaess‚ which the writer makes to
eonsist in avoiding evil, that is, in refraining from
sins, of which he enumerates the principal, and
in doing good, that is, in keeping God’s com·
mandments. He exhorts the people to render
tithes of their fruits to the Lord, in order to bring
down His blessing upon their labours: to come
to church often, especially on Holy·days; to
make no ‘ delay in confessing their sins, and pro·-
curing absolution frorn them.

The fourth homily contains an explanation of
the Beatitudes. Confession is stated to be the
necessary means whereby our sins are forgiven:

them whether we will or not. Itis better to
confess our sins to one man, than be brought
into public and put to confusion for our sins on
the'terrible day of judgment, before the tribes of
heaven, of earth, and of hell.'’

The fifth treats of faithffand of works oscharity.

Boniface reminds his hearers of the promises
which they made at their baptism, to believe
in three persons and one God. He then warns
them that faith is dead without works, and that
it« is necessary to love with all their heort Him
